**The source code will be available soon.**

The documentation is accessible by executing the following command from the ``docs`` folder :
```bash
python -m http.server <port>
```

Or if ``http.server`` does not exist :
```bash
python -m SimpleHttpServer <port>
```

Then, you can access to the documentation from your favorite web browser at : `http://localhost:<port>`
